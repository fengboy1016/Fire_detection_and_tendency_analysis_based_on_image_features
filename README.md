# Fire detection and tendency analysis based on image features
***A matlab lab: Fire detection and tendency analysis based on image features***
## Introduction
The system is called -- *Fire detection and trend analysis system based on image feature*.

**The realized function** is that the system can detect the flame and smoke in the process of fire, derive the situation of flame and smoke changing with time and the effect of detection video, and analyze the development trend of fire.

**The principle** of the system is to establish the digital image feature model of flame and smoke according to the characteristics of flame and smoke such as color, texture, turbulence and flutter through digital image processing technology.Set reasonable threshold to realize the detection of flame and smoke in fire;Establish the fire development model, according to the existing data, analyze the fire development trend, and make reasonable prediction.

**The application scenario** of this system is deployed in places with dense population such as outdoor places, warehouses, docks and forests. Video monitoring and video image model are used to conduct remote fire detection and fire situation trend analysis, so as to escort the safety of people's life and property and social and economic development.

**This system has the good man-machine interaction performance**, the operation is simple;Due to the image feature, the hardware requirements are not high, easy to implement, can be used in general computer system simulation verification, can also be deployed on a specific embedded device, play a role in a specific scene.
